    @* ROUTING BASE: 
       This is critical. It tells the browser that all links are relative to the root "/".
       Without this, reloading a page like "/shelter/dashboard" would break because 
       the browser would look for CSS files inside the "/shelter/" folder. 
    *@
    <base href="/" />

    @* STYLESHEETS: *@
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css" /> @* The CSS Framework *@
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css" />                     @* Your Global Custom Styles *@

    @* CSS ISOLATION BUNDLE:
       Blazor creates this file automatically during the build.
       It takes the specific styles from "NavMenu.razor.css", "MainLayout.razor.css", etc.,
       and combines them into this single file so they don't conflict with each other.
    *@
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="PAWPALme.styles.css" />

    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png" />

    @* DYNAMIC HEAD CONTENT:
       This component listens for <PageTitle> tags on other pages.
       If Home.razor says <PageTitle>Home</PageTitle>, this component injects "Home" 
       into the browser tab name here.
    *@
    <HeadOutlet />
</head>

<body>
    @* THE ROUTER:
       This is where the entire Blazor app lives. 
       It looks at the URL, finds the matching @page component, wraps it in the MainLayout, 
       and renders it right here inside the body tag.
    *@
    <Routes />

    @* BLAZOR ENGINE:
       This script starts the framework.
       For Blazor Server, it establishes the SignalR WebSocket connection to the server.
       For Blazor WebAssembly, it downloads the .NET runtime to the browser.
