<div class="page">
    @* NAVIGATION BAR:
       This container holds the NavMenu component we just looked at.
       It sits at the top of the page and stays there even when you change pages.
    *@
    <div class="top-nav-container">
        <NavMenu />
    </div>

    @* MAIN CONTENT AREA:
       The <main> tag is semantic HTML for accessibility (screen readers know this is the important part).
    *@
    <main>
        <div class="content px-4">
            @* THE DYNAMIC BODY:
               This '@Body' tag is the most critical part of a Layout.
               It acts as a placeholder. When you navigate to "/pets", the Pets.razor content is injected here.
               When you go to "/login", the Login.razor content is injected here.
            *@
            @Body
        </div>
    </main>
</div>

@* GLOBAL ERROR HANDLER:
   This hidden div automatically appears if the Blazor app crashes (e.g., unhandled exception).
   It gives the user a way to reload the app without refreshing the browser manually.
   The styling for this is usually in app.css or MainLayout.razor.css.

    <a href="" class="reload">Reload</a>
