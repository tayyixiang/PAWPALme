<h1 class="text-danger">Error.</h1>
<h2 class="text-danger">An error occurred while processing your request.</h2>

@* CONDITIONAL DISPLAY:
   We only show the Request ID if one was successfully captured.
   This ID is crucial for developers. It acts like a "Ticket Number" to find the specific crash in the server logs.

@if (ShowRequestId)
{
    <p>
        <strong>Request ID:</strong> <code>@RequestId</code>
    </p>

<h3>Development Mode</h3>
<p>
    Swapping to <strong>Development</strong> environment will display more detailed information about the error that occurred.

    @* SECURITY WARNING:
       This text explains why real users see this generic page instead of the actual code crash.
       Showing raw exceptions (Stack Traces) to the public is a security risk because it can reveal database table names or file paths to hackers.
    *@
    <strong>The Development environment shouldn't be enabled for deployed applications.</strong>
    It can result in displaying sensitive information from exceptions to end users.
    For local debugging, enable the <strong>Development</strong> environment by setting the <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</strong> environment variable to <strong>Development</strong>
    and restarting the app.
